# sam.gov dot.band

**sam.gov dot.band** is a closed-loop federal leasing execution environment under **NAICS 531120**.

It converts SAM.gov notices into controlled execution using a fixed doctrine:

## ✋ The 5 Palm
1. **SAM.gov = Trigger**  
   Signals opportunity only. No decisions live here.

2. **Forms = Ports**  
   Interchangeable inputs (Form A / B / C).

3. **Ledger = Spine**  
   Single source of truth — past, present, future.

4. **Grid = Weapon**  
   View-only decision surface presenting lease-ready options.

5. **dot.band = Wrapper**  
   One packet = one complete execution node.
